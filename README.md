# Agent System

`agent-system` is a private orchestration layer for agentic coding work. It complements Superpowers instead of replacing it.

Superpowers decides how to work: brainstorming, planning, debugging, or test-driven execution. Agent System decides who owns the work, what artifacts must exist, and what proof is needed before delivery.

## What lives here

- `agent-system.json` is the source of truth for host support, bootstrap files, profile discovery, and artifact paths.
- `profiles/<profile>/profile.json` defines route logic and domain ownership for a specific workspace.
- `profiles/<profile>/AGENTS.md` is the human-readable companion for that profile.
- `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, and `templates/` provide the shared orchestration surface.
- `adapters/` holds host-specific bootstrap notes for Claude Code, Codex, and Qwen Code.

## Supported hosts

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Qwen Code

## V0.1 scope

This release is the scaffold: a universal core, one profile pack shape, and thin host adapters. It is not a full autonomous dispatcher.

## Bootstrap flow

1. Read `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
2. Load `agent-system.json`.
3. Open the host-specific bootstrap file.
4. Select the active profile.
5. Emit the required route, handoff, and delivery artifacts.

If a host cannot load a richer integration, use the markdown files directly and keep the structured manifest authoritative.
